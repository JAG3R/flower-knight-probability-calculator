# flower-knight-probability-calculator
This program is for the DMM game-- "Flower Knight Girl", searching for the best passing probability.
After editing the main.py, run.

Editing main.py:
First of all, you need to get a snapshot of the level map.
And the size MUST be 960X640 pixels so that the ratio transfer will be correct.
You can find the map on Flower Knight Girl wiki (Japanese version).

Note:Usually, the size is 960X640. If not, you must take a screenshot yourself.

The '?' part is the place that you have to edit.
I have added #remark so that you can see how to edit it.
Take level 12-4 for example:
